    <h2 class="HowistheIBprogramdifferentfromTheAdvancedProgram">How is the IB program different from The Advanced Program(AP)?</h2>
    <p class="HowistheIBprogramdifferentfromTheAdvancedProgram">IB is a challenging program where students complete a balanced set of academic courses and participate in non-academic requirements that build important skills such critical thinking, problem solving, communication, creativity, collaboration, teamwork, and resilience.  IB students graduate with an International Baccalaureate World School Diploma and an Ontario Secondary School diploma. AP is also near the same skill level but the only difference is the AP program is only applied to some specific subjects such as English, Math, or Science, Due to this, you may be strong and can easily evaluate yourself in those subjects but you may lack intelligence and knowledge in other subjects that are important to your education</p>

    <h2 class="Whatyouneedtoachievetomeettherequirements">What You Need to Achieve to Meet the Requirements</h2>
    <p class="Whatyouneedtoachievetomeettherequirements">To meet the requirements of the IB application standards, in most cases there will be an IB entrance exam but it also depends on the school that someone may be applying for. If you get a high score on the test, you have 50% guarantee your spot in IB. If there is no IB entrance exam, it usually depends on your grades final report card in 7th grade and your progress report in 8th grade. Your report card in 8th grade will not count as your application will be submitted and most likely you would’ve already got you offer letter by that point. In 7th grade, you need to have a minimum of a 75% overall average, “Progressing Very Well" and "Progressing well" on the grade 8 progress report card, and a Good to Excellent Learning Skills on final grade 7 report card and grade 8 progress report card.</p>
